        "- Sử dụng dataset https://raw.githubusercontent.com/automoto/big-five-data/master/big_five_scores.csv. sau một vài phân tích thăm dò đơn giản thì em quyết định train toàn bộ dataset, không phân biệt các nước, vì giá trị trung vị của từng loại tính cách mặc dù có lệch, nhưng nó phản ánh su hướng chung của tính cách. các cột điểm tính cách đều sạch, không bị thiếu nhãn giá trị.\n",
        "- quá trình training sử dụng sklearn.decomposition.PCA\n",
        "- gọi tên model là pca_evaluator\n",
        "- kết quả cuối cùng là một file tensorflowlite để ứng dụng React Native có thể sử dụng.\n",
        "- thuật toán so sánh hai giá trị PCA là hàm cosine_similarity (sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity). thuật toán so sánh không nằm trong quy trình của model mà trong tương lai sẽ được database server thực hiện\n",
        "- Để test model, trong notebook có mục Interactive test\n",
        "- Phần Objective là nội dung mà em thống nhất với Product Owner.\n",

        "- Model không cần biết nội dung câu hỏi, mà chỉ quan tâm kết quả cuối cùng của 5 thang điểm tính cách trong khoảng giá trị từ 0-1\n",
        "- nội dung câu hỏi và code để tổng hợp điểm sẽ được ứng dụng mobile chạy\n",
        "- mục đích ban đầu khi tạo ra model thay vì sử dụng code thuần trên source code là vì kể cả khi hacker truy ngược được source code từ APK, thì họ vẫn không thể truy ngược lại thuật toán biển đổi. Tuy nhiên với cách làm hiện tại, khi sử dụng file tensorflow lite, thì hacker vẫn truy được thuật toán của file tensorflow lite.\n",
        "- Nghĩa là source code của app an toàn chừng nào thì thuật toán của model cũng an toàn chừng đấy,không có kỹ thuật bảo mật nâng cao nào hơn. tuy nhiên vẫn đảm bảo được dữ liệu người dùng.   \n",
        "- Một cách để exploit thuật toán biến đổi để reverse engineer thuật toán là họ cần tìm giá trị trung vị của PCA cho từng kết quả trắc nghiệm tính cách. Tuy nhiên thì giá trị của PCA được lưu trên cloud database của Supabase, và kết quả thực của trắc nghiệm tính cách (chưa được transform) thì lại càng không được database lưu.\n",
        "\n",
        "**những điểm cần xem xét**\n",
        "- có nên sử dụng PCA 4 chiều thay vì PCA 2 chiều không. vì PCA 2 chiều chỉ đại diện 60% giá trị ban đầu của kết quả, trong khi PCA 4 chiều đại diện 90% giá trị. Bảo toàn 100% giá trị theo như em tìm hiểu thì PCA không thể làm được, và giữ nguyên giá trị 5 chiều thì sẽ ảnh hưởng đến vấn đề quyền riêng tư.\n",
        "- PCA transformation của model không áp dụng thuật toán ngẫu nhiên, nên với mỗi kết quả trắc nghiệm, model sẽ đưa ra giá trị duy nhất cho kết quả đó mà không có biến số nào chen vào.\n",

        "\n",
        "Extraversion is typically characterized by an individual's tendency to seek out social interaction and stimulation, as well as their level of enthusiasm and assertiveness in social situations. Individuals who score high on this dimension tend to be outgoing, sociable, and talkative. They enjoy being around others and seek out social situations. They are often described as having a high level of energy, enthusiasm, and assertiveness. They may also be more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviors, such as partying, drinking, or other forms of excitement-seeking.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, individuals who score low on extraversion are more introverted and reserved. They may prefer to spend time alone or in small groups, and may feel uncomfortable in large social gatherings. They may also be less assertive and more cautious in their interactions with others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research has shown that extraversion is linked to a range of outcomes, including job performance, social support, and well-being. For example, individuals who score high on extraversion tend to be more successful in careers that involve social interaction and communication. They may also have more social support networks and experience higher levels of subjective well-being.\n",

        "\n",
        "Individuals who score high on emotional stability are characterized as being emotionally resilient, calm, and even-tempered. They tend to experience fewer negative emotions and are better able to cope with stress and adversity. They are also more likely to exhibit positive emotions, such as happiness, contentment, and enthusiasm.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, individuals who score low on emotional stability tend to be more prone to negative emotions, such as anxiety, depression, and anger. They may be more reactive to stress and may find it difficult to cope with challenging situations. They may also exhibit a range of maladaptive behaviors, such as substance abuse or self-harm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research has shown that emotional stability is linked to a range of outcomes, including mental health, physical health, and interpersonal relationships. For example, individuals who score high on emotional stability tend to have better mental health outcomes, such as lower rates of depression and anxiety. They may also have better physical health outcomes, such as lower rates of cardiovascular disease. Additionally, they tend to have more stable and supportive relationships with others.\n",

        "Research has shown that agreeableness is linked to a range of outcomes, including interpersonal relationships, job performance, and mental health. For example, individuals who score high on agreeableness tend to have more positive and supportive relationships with others. They may also be more successful in careers that require teamwork and collaboration. Additionally, they tend to have better mental health outcomes, such as lower rates of depression and anxiety. However, it is important to note that excessively high levels of agreeableness can also have negative consequences, such as being overly compliant or lacking assertiveness.\n",

        "\n",
        "In contrast, individuals who score low on conscientiousness tend to be more impulsive and disorganized. They may have difficulty setting and achieving goals, and may be more likely to engage in behaviors that are not in their best interest.\n",

        "Research has shown that conscientiousness is linked to a range of outcomes, including academic and job performance, health behaviors, and longevity. For example, individuals who score high on conscientiousness tend to have better academic and job performance, as well as lower rates of absenteeism and turnover.

        "\n",
        "Individuals who score high on openness to experience are characterized as being imaginative, curious, and open to new ideas and experiences. They tend to be intellectually curious and enjoy exploring new concepts and ideas. They may also exhibit a preference for creativity and aesthetics.\n",
        "\n",
        "In contrast, individuals who score low on openness to experience tend to be more traditional and conservative. They may have a preference for familiar and predictable experiences, and may be less likely to seek out novel experiences.\n",
        "\n",
        "Research has shown that openness to experience is linked to a range of outcomes, including creativity, innovation, and cultural competence. For example, individuals who score high on openness to experience tend to be more creative and innovative, and may be more successful in careers that require these skills. Additionally, they tend to be more open-minded and accepting of diverse cultures and perspectives.\n",
